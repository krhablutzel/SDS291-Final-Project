(6) MEPS cannot be used to study small geographic areas.  The smallest geographical areas identified in the MEPS are regions (groups of states) and a limited number of metropolitan areas.

(7) This system provides individual-level data only.  The MEPS Data Extraction System will not produce tables. You will need to use a statistical software package, such as Stata, SAS, or SPSS, to analyze the downloaded data.  Alternatively, you may use the MEPS-SDA tabulator to produce tables online, without making a data extract.]]></conditions>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUID reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUID is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample [URL omitted from DDI.] is a subset of the households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description [URL omitted from DDI.] document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey. 

From 1996-2017, DUID is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANEL to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUID begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUID can be combined with PID to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit. Please see the user note [URL omitted from DDI.] for more information on the relationship between Dwelling Units, families, Reporting Units, and persons.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, MEPSID is a variable that uniquely identifies respondents across MEPS panels. It is created by combining PANEL, DUID, and PID. IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSID for the 1996-2017 samples to provide a single, universal linking key for MEPS persons. Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUID and DUPERSID (which combines DUID with PID) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANEL to the first two columns. This update makes DUPERSID identical to MEPSID in the IPUMS MEPS extract system for 2018-forward.

In earlier versions of IPUMS MEPS, IPUMS MEPS staff created a slightly different version of MEPSID, equivalent to combining DUID, PID, and PANEL. This version has been renamed to MEPSID2 and is only available for 1996-2017.]]></txt>

Date of birth and age were asked for each reporting unit member, and then exact age was calculated from date of birth. Where the calculated age and the age provided did not match, inconsistencies were reviewed and resolved. When date of birth was not provided, but age was provided, the month and year of birth were assigned randomly from among the possible valid options. For any cases still not accounted, age was imputed using:
(1) the mean age difference between MEPS participants with certain family relationships (where available) or  
(2) the mean age value for MEPS participants.

      <labl>Constructed total MEPS family income</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[Available in all survey years, FTOTINCMEPS is an IPUMS MEPS constructed variable that sums total personal income (INCTOT) (excluding tax refunds and capital gains) across the MEPS family to report the total income for each person's MEPS family.

MEPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption, fostering, or cohabitation, and residing together. Unlike the CPS defined family, MEPS family does include unmarried partners and foster children.

FTOTINCMEPS was derived by constructing person-level total income comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. FTOTINCMEPS was constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income 

Person-level income totals were then summed over MEPS family members, as defined by FAMIDYR, to yield MEPS family-level total income.

Beginning in 2007, the variable FTOTVAL was constructed from the person-level total income variable (INCTOT). Additionally, the variable FTOTINCCPS is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for CPS families (excludes foster children and unmarried partners). Like FTOTINCMEPS, FTOTINCCPS is constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income)]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons eligible for the Access to Care supplement (AC) (ACCESSELIG), USUALPL indicates whether they have a particular doctor's office, clinic, health center, or other place they usually go if they are sick or need advice about their health.

Notes about the Universe

In the course of investigating this variable for integration, IPUMS MEPS staff discovered some non-adherent cases in 1999-2001. In 1999, three individuals are marked as eligible for the Access to Care Supplement, but are not in universe for USUALPL. In 2000, there are nine people who meet those same criteria and in 2001 there are six people. From 2002 forward, all people who are eligible for the AC are also in universe for USUALPL.


The Access to Care Supplement
This variable is part of the Access to Care supplement, a section of the MEPS HC survey fielded to participants in Rounds 2 and 4 of data collection to gain information on barriers family members have faced in obtaining needed health care, the usual source of care for all family members, and characteristics of usual source of care health providers. MEPS administers the AC to all current RU members in Rounds 2 and 4, excluding those who are deceased or institutionalized (ACCESSELIG). This section was redesigned in 2002 (Panel 6 Round 4 and Panel 7 Round 2) to focus more on possible language barriers and other problems faced in obtaining necessary health, dental, or prescription medicine care.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons eligible for the Access to Care supplement (ACCESSELIG) who have a usual source of care provider (USUALPL) that is either a facility, a person working in a facility, or was not ascertained (USCPRFAC), TYPPLSICK reports the type of place they use as their usual source of care when sick or need advice about their health. 

TYPPLSICK is collected as part of the Access to Care supplement, which gathers information on barriers family members have faced in obtaining needed health care, the usual source of care for all family members, and characteristics of usual source of care health providers. For related variables and more information, please see USUALPL.

Notes about the Universe

In 2001, two individuals are eligible for the Access to Care Supplement (ACCESSELIG), indicate they have a usual source of care provider (USUALPL), and are out of universe for USCPRFAC, but still have valid responses to TYPPLSICK. Otherwise, the stated universe holds true.
