# SDS291-Final-Project

This is our group's final statistical analysis project for SDS291 Multiple Regression under Professor Miles Ott at Smith College, Fall 2020. We are using data from the IPUMS MEPS database to analyse whether income and insurance coverage types are associated with whether someone has a usual place for medical care.
